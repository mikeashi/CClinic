This problem is about calculating statistics from a data set.  
each observation in the data includes several varibales:


|     Variable      |   Value    | format |
|-------------------|------------|--------|
| Date              | 2012_01_01 | y_m_d  |
| Time              | 00:02:14   | h_m_s  |
| Air_Temp          | 34.30      | F      |
| Barinetruc_Press  | 30.50      | inHg   |
| Dew_Point         | 26.90      |        |
| Relative_Humidity | 74.20      | %      |
| Wind_Dir          | 346.40     | deg    |
| Wind_Gust         | 11.00      | mph    |
| Wind_Speed        | 3.60       | mph    |
